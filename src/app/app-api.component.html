  Angular 5 makes nice UI but it can't operate without data! RESTFul API is the future. I am using ASP.NET MVC to build the API Application. You can visit api site at <a href="//api.aspnet4you.com" target="_blank">api.aspnet4you.com</a> and/or find the API documentations at
  <a href="//api.aspnet4you.com/swagger" target="_blank">api.aspnet4you.com/swagger</a>.
